# Orsom-cookies

## Introduction

The data is made up for year 2019 & 2020 and it is for a  fictional cookies company, named Orsom. I have generated  this dataset to display my skills in data cleaning, analysis and visualization.

**_Disclaimer_**: The datasets used are fabricated and do not depict any real company, institution, or country. They are solely for demonstration purposes to showcase my capabilities to utilize MS-Excel in building visualization dashboard.

MS-Excel concept application:
- Pivot Tables: From the datasets, three diffrent pivot tables were generated and graphs plotted accordingly
- Filters: Year, country and products filters were integrated with visual graphs to reflect desired result upon drilling down to specifics on any filter component.

## Problem Statements

- What is the profit by market and product type?
- What is the trend of monthly profit?
- When was the highest profit realized?
- What is the monthly trend of sales and profit?
- Which country/region accounts for chunk of market share and profits?

## Data Source

The Orsom cookies  dataset was made up for demonstrative purposes of my Excel skills. It is meant to give an insight to Orsom cookie management for strategic decisions sales, profit earned, and how to chart a way forward  for improved performance.
- The data comprises of 1,226 rows and 7 columns.

## Data Generation/Transformation

Given that the datasets were auto generated using the 'rand between' Excel command, there was no need for data cleaning for missing values, wrong data formats. However, columns were formatted as appropriate and datasets modified as a table to suit pivot purposes.
